VIM configuration
=================

Installation
------------

Run the following command inside your home folder:

    wget -O - https://raw.github.com/balintk/vimrc/master/install.sh | sh

It creates the *~/vimrc* for all the VIM-related files, downloads the plugins, and symlink the *.vim* folder and *.vimrc* file from the right places.
